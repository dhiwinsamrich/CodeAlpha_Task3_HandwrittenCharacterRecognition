# Handwritten Character Recognition System

## Project Overview
🚀 Exciting Project Update from My Internship at CodeAlpha! 🚀

I am thrilled to share another fascinating project I worked on during my internship at CodeAlpha! 🎉

### Handwritten Character Recognition

📊 **Project Title:** Handwritten Character Recognition System

As part of my internship, I developed a cutting-edge handwritten character recognition system capable of recognizing various handwritten characters and alphabets. This project has the potential to extend its capabilities to recognize entire words or sentences, showcasing the immense possibilities of machine learning in text recognition.

## Project Highlights
🌟 **Project Highlights:**
1. **Objective:** Develop a system to accurately recognize handwritten characters, with future extensions to words and sentences.
2. **Data Used:** A diverse dataset of handwritten characters to train and validate the model.
3. **Algorithms Implemented:**
   - Sequential Model (Deep Learning)

## Methodology
🔍 **Methodology:**
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Used LabelBinarizer to convert categorical labels into binary format, facilitating efficient training.
   - Normalized and augmented the dataset to improve model generalization.
2. **Model Architecture:**
   - Built a Sequential model using deep learning frameworks, designed to handle the complexities of character recognition.
3. **Training and Evaluation:**
   - Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
   - Trained the model using multiple epochs to ensure optimal performance.

## Results
📈 **Results:**
- **Loss:** 0.1593 
- **Accuracy:** 94.00% 
- **Validation Loss:** 0.2885 
- **Validation Accuracy:** 90.99%

## Key Learnings
